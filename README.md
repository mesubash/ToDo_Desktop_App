<h4>ToDo Desktop Application</h4>

This is a simple user-friendly desktop application developed using JavaFX for the college project.

Before expecting too much from the project please note that it was developed within 2 days, and it is for the simple CRUD
operation fulfilling project for the practice of the JavaFX.
The simple purpose for the development is to get used to with the development of the desktop application and the
completion of the Java project.
I have used fxml for the layout design using the SceneBuilder tools that helped me a lot though-out the design of
the UI.
I have referenced the logic from websites and the AI tools like openai.

*Design is not responsive, and it is currently well working in 14'. So may feel some layout mistakes


Here, in the project I have used just simple logic and some components are still not developed due to lack of time.
Those components include the register and forget password features from the login interface.
You can enhance them and suggest me to make it better everytime.

Database is used for the tasks store, and you may feel some betterment need out there, please consider this.

before running this make sure that your have mysql localserver active and have the same database and tables
with necessary fields out there. I have given the table schemas out there under the resources.
Feel free to make changes for the betterment of the application.

Except for the remember me feature and the session I have tried to include all the features out there.
I have used the database for the verification codes being sent to user mail to verify it is working code and valid.

In Short:
Tools:
Language: JavaFX(JAVA)
Layout design: SceneBuilder, fxml
Database: MySQL
-Bcrypt for password hashing
-Gmail server for mail sending


* database is in localserver
* make sure you have used the proper external library files like mysql connector,mail activation lib, Bcrypt lib etc
 * you can use all the features like registering the user and the forger password as well
