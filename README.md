<h4>ToDo Desktop Application</h4>

This is a simple user-friendly desktop application developed using JavaFX for the college project.

Before expecting too much from the project please note that it was developed within 2 days and it is for the simple CRUD
operation fulfilling project for the practice of the JavaFX.
The simple purpose for the development is to get used to with the development of the desktop application and the 
completion of the Java project.
I have used fxml for the layout design using the SceneBuilder tools that helped me a lot thoughout the design of 
the UI.
I have referenced the logic from websites and the AI tools like openai. 

*Design is not responsive and it is currently well working in 14'. So may feel some layout mistaked


Here, in the project I have used just simple logic and some components are still not developed due to lack of time.
Those components include the register and forget password features from the login interface.
You can enhance them and suggest me to make it better everytime.

Database is used for the tasks store and you may feel some betterment need out there, please consider this.

before running this make sure that your have turned on the localserver like Xampp and have the same database and tables 
with necessary fields out there. I have given the table schemas out there under the resources.
Feel free to make changes for the betterment of the application.

I have included the dummy register and forgot password scenes just to make the buttons and links fromlogin scene working,
you can design and make necessary changes to make them working.

In Short:
Tools:
IDE: Intellij
LocalServer: Xampp
Language: JavaFX(JAVA)
Layout design: SceneBuilder
Database: MySQL


* make sure you have used the proper external library files like mysql connector etc
